# GenAI-Powered Email Processing System

## üéØ Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive guide for developers seeking to understand, utilize, and extend the AI-powered email processing system. The system is designed to extract key information from emails in various formats (.eml, .pdf, .docx) and classify them based on their content and create a service request and route the request to the respective teams or individuals based on skills and roles

## üí° Inspiration
Business Description:
Our AI-powered Email Processing System solves critical financial communication challenges by automatically classifying, extracting, and routing emails containing complex financial information. The solution dramatically reduces manual processing time, minimizes human error, and ensures consistent handling of diverse email communications across financial operations.
Technical Description:
A Python-based, AI-driven email processing pipeline that leverages Google Generative AI and OCR technologies to:

Ingest multi-format documents (EML, PDF, DOCX)
Extract text and image-based content
Classify emails using machine learning
Generate structured service intake requests
Support intelligent routing and attribute extraction

Key Technical Components:

Language: Python
AI Engine: Google Generative AI (Gemini)
OCR: Pytesseract
Supported Formats: EML, PDF, DOCX
Output: Structured JSON
Processing: Modular, extensible pipeline

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does
Solution: 
The system follows a modular AI pipeline architecture:

 1. Ingestion Collection Stage : Gathers email data from different sources.
 2. Preprocessing: processs the emails in various formats (.eml, .pdf, .docx) and extracts the email text
 3. Metadata Extraction: Extracts email headers (sender, recipient, etc.). ¬† 
 4. Email Signature Detection: Identifies and extracts email signatures. ¬†
 5. Confidence Score
 6. Key Attributes Extraction: Uses the Gemini API to extract specific data from the email body (dates, amounts, etc.). ¬† 
 7. Content Classification: Employs the Gemini API to classify emails into request types and sub request types.¬† 

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It
## Dependencies
* Python 3.12.6
* pip (Package Installer for Python)
* A virtual environment (recommended)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ewfx/gaied-elite-eagles
    cd Email_Classification_Project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    C:\Syed\Workspace\Hackathon_2025\Email_Classification_Project>python --version
    Python 3.12.6

    C:\Syed\Workspace\Hackathon_2025\Email_Classification_Project>pip --version
    pip 24.2 from C:\Syed\Workspace\Hackathon_2025\python-3.12.6\Lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.12)

    C:\Syed\Workspace\Hackathon_2025\Email_Classification_Project>python -m venv my_env

    C:\Syed\Workspace\Hackathon_2025\Email_Classification_Project>my_env\Scripts\activate

    (my_env) C:\Syed\Workspace\Hackathon_2025\Email_Classification_Project>
    ```

3.  **Install package dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai
    pip install requests
    pip install pandas
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install requests
    pip install transformers
    pip install torch PyPDF2 pytesseract pdf2image
    pip install openai
    pip install spacy

    ```
  
4.  **Install Tesseract OCR (for PDF text extraction):**

    * You'll need to install Tesseract OCR separately.
    * **Windows:** Download the installer from [https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and add the Tesseract executable to your system's PATH environment variable.
   
5.  **Configure API Keys:**

    * Obtain the necessary API keys from Google Generative AI,and add the API key to the `genai_email_classifaction_engine.py` file

6.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python src/main/genai_email_classifaction_engine.py #or however you start your program.
    ```
## Output

The system outputs extracted data and classification results in JSON format.
